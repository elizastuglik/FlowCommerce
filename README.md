# FlowCommerce

FlowCommerce
FlowCommerce is an innovative e-commerce platform developed as part of my thesis project for the MA program in <b>"Digital Humanities and Digital Knowledge"</b> (a.y. 2022/2023) under the supervision of Prof. Vitali. The platform demonstrates how dynamic web applications can be built using a "zero-JavaScript" approach with HTMX, simplifying the development process and making it accessible for developers of all skill levels.

The project also explores the use of motivational design patterns based on psychological principles to enhance user engagement and interaction, providing a user-centered approach to e-commerce development.
